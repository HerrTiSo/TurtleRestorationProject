# Turtle Restoration Project (TRP)

> *"Ye think ye know the lands o' Azeroth, do ye? There's much yet to discover, if yer willing to seek it."* – Brann Bronzebeard

The **Turtle Restoration Project** (TRP) enhances the world maps and loading screens of World of Warcraft’s classic era (version 1.12.1) through machine learning upscaling, tailored specifically for [**Turtle WoW**](https://turtle-wow.org). Created to complement the server’s fan-made expansion, **Mysteries of Azeroth**, TRP aligns with the server’s mission to deepen players’ connection to the **Vanilla WoW** world, capturing Azeroth’s timeless sense of adventure.

At higher resolutions, the original Vanilla maps and loading screens appear blurry and lack detail. TRP addresses this by doubling the in-game resolution of map and loading screen files, while effectively increasing visual detail up to four times. The result is a sharper experience that enhances exploration and transitions, while preserving Azeroth’s iconic charm.

**Note:** While TRP aims for high-resolution quality, the limitations of the old WoW engine require careful adjustments to avoid crashes or instability. As a result, the final map quality may not fully match the resolution of current retail WoW maps but should come impressively close.

TRP is built in a modular way, following a three-phase approach for each map:

1. **Upscaling and Fixing Major Errors**: Initial upscaling of the map and addressing any prominent errors that may arise.
2. **Refining Labels**: Adjusting and improving labels, such as city names and region titles, to ensure clarity and alignment.
3. **Enhancing Visual Details**: Adding final touches to enhance other design elements for a polished, immersive look.

Starting with the major cities, each map requires considerable time and effort as I carefully work through these stages.

In the future, TRP may expand to other private servers under the name **Azeroth Restoration Project**, bringing the same visual upgrades to the broader WoW classic community.
